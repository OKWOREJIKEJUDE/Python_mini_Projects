#Create a simple calculator program that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

firstNumber = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
secondNumber = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

addition = firstNumber + secondNumber
print(f"The addition of {firstNumber} and {secondNumber} is {addition}")

subtraction = firstNumber - secondNumber
print(f"The subtraction of {firstNumber} and {secondNumber} is {subtraction}")

division = firstNumber / secondNumber
print(f"The division of {firstNumber} and {secondNumber} is {division}")

multiplication = firstNumber * secondNumber
print(f"The multiplication of {firstNumber} and {secondNumber} is {multiplication}")
